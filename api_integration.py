# Python API Integration Project
# Objective:
# The objective of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in creating,
# a communication interface with an external API using Python.
# Students will learn how to make HTTP requests, handle API responses, and work with data retrieved from the API.
#
# Requirements:
# Basic knowledge of Python programming.
# Familiarity with HTTP concepts (GET and POST requests).
# Understanding of JSON data format.
# Task Description: In this project,
# students will develop a Python program that communicates with a chosen public API.
# You can let the students select an API of their choice, but some suggestions include:
#
# Weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
# RESTful APIs for a social media platform (e.g., Twitter or Reddit)
# Currency exchange rate API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates)
# Public transportation data (e.g., using Google Maps API)
# Here are the steps students should follow to complete the project:
# Choose an API: You can choose a public API that interests you or matches the goals of the project.
# Make sure the API you choose offers good documentation.
#
# Research and understand the API: Students should thoroughly read the API documentation to understand its endpoints,
# request methods, and data format (usually JSON).
#
# Create a Python script: Write Python code to make a GET request to the chosen API's endpoint.
#
# Handle the API response, including error handling for potential issues like rate limiting or network errors.
#
# Parse the response data (usually in JSON format) and extract relevant information.
#
# Implement a use case: Students should create a specific use case for their API integration.
# For example, if using a weather API,
# they can write a program that fetches the current weather for a user-defined location and displays it.
#
# User-friendly interface: Depending on the use case,
# students can create a simple text-based or graphical user interface to interact with the API.
#
# Testing and debugging: Students should thoroughly test their
# Python script and handle any errors or issues that may arise.
